# **A Go package to automatically update your game**
<br/>

## **Installation**
### Run one of the following:
```sh
go build
```
### OR
```sh
go run .
```
<br/>

## **Don't have go installed? That's fine, I included prebuilt binaries for you to run, check releases!**
<br />

## Note: The dotenv is set to 14.426.3 on purpose. At the time of writing, 14.426.4 is the most recent version of coc and so the program won't attempt to fetch the newest APK
